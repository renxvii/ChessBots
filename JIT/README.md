This is a selection of iterations of chess bots I made over the course of several years, 2017-20211.
They are not "smart", but they are capable of a decent level of play. I used machine learning to optimise the position values over the course of many games played
- though it was not altogether perfect, since it was optimised for the bots to play against themselves, so it is a local optimum rather than a global one.
